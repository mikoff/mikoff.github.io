      <description>Probability density and cumulative distribution functions Probability denisity function $f(x)$ is a function, which allows us to evaluate the probability that the sample, drawn from the distribution, will be equal to the value $X$. Also we can use PDF to calculate the probability that the randomly drawn sample from distribution will be in certain range, for example, $a \leq X \leq b$. This probability equals to the area under the PDF curve on the given interval and can be calculated by integration: $$ P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int _a^b f(x) dx $$</description>

      <description>Hi there! For every engineer and developer the continious self-studying is a must. Everyday we read, try to solve problems and clarify the concepts, write the code and visualise the things, which help us to get an insights.
I am interested in Navigation and Positioning, Statistics, Autonomous vehicles and Robotics. These topics are huge, and what is more important, they are about future of humanity.
To summarize all the things, which I am doing and share the ideas I decided to post about it.</description>
