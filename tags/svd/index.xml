      <description>Point cloud alignment and SVD Singular value decomposition Recently I studied the problem of finding the rotation and translation between two point sets and decided to write the post about it. The key here is singular value decomposition, or SVD.
It is extremely popular technique in many types of linear problems. It should be not surprised, that the point cloud alignment problem can be solved with its help. My aim here is to show all accommpanying theory and provide the point cloud alignment algorithm that takes not more than 10 lines of code in Python.</description>
