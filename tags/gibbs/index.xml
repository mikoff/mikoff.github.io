To draw samples from them the numerical procedures are used. In the following note I would like to demonstrate few approaches for one particular example: having 2D robot perception and a map we want to sample most probable poses of this robot. This problem often emerges during initialization or re-initialization of the estimated robot pose when the filter diverged or needs to be initialized from scratch and we want to guarantee the fast convergence.</description></item></channel></rss>
