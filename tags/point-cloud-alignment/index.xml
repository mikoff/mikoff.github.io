The pose of the robot can be described through rotation and translation. Rotations, however, do not belong to the vector space: we are not allowed to sum the rotations or multiply them by a scalar, because the resulting element will not belong to SO(3) group.</description></item><item><title>Point cloud alignment and SVD</title><link>https://mikoff.github.io/posts/point-cloud-alignment.md/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://mikoff.github.io/posts/point-cloud-alignment.md/</guid><description>Point cloud alignment and SVD Link to heading Singular value decomposition Link to heading Recently I studied the problem of finding the rotation and translation between two point sets and decided to write the post about it. The key here is singular value decomposition, or SVD.
It is extremely popular technique in many types of linear problems. It should be not surprised, that the point cloud alignment problem can be solved with its help.</description></item></channel></rss>
