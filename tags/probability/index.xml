It turned out to be counter-intuitive that we need not only transform the pdf by the selected function, but also multiply it by the derivative of the inverse function w.r.t. substituted variable. While delving into the details of this topic, I found the following sources to be quite useful: [2]2, [3]3, [4]4, [5]5.</description></item><item><title>Likelihood and probability normalization, log-sum-exp trick</title><link>https://mikoff.github.io/posts/likelihood-and-log-sum-exp/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2023 23:00:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://mikoff.github.io/posts/likelihood-and-log-sum-exp/</guid><description>Working with probabilities involves multiplication and normalization of their values. Since the numerical values sometimes are extremely low that can lead to underflow problems. This problem is evident with particle filters - we have to multiply really low likelihood values that vanish in the end. Log-sum-exp allows to abbreviate this problem.
Approach Link to heading Log-likelihoods Link to heading Since the likelihood values can be extremely low it is more convenient to work with loglikelihood instead of likelihood: $$ \log(\mathcal{L}).</description></item></channel></rss>
