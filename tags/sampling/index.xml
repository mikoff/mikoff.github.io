So why particle filter is so widely used? It&amp;rsquo;s widespread application lies in its versatile nature and universalism. The filter is able to:
Work with nonlinearities. Handle non-gaussian distributions. Easily fuse various information sources. Simulate the processes. My sample implementation takes less then 100 lines of Python code and can be found here.</description></item><item><title>Inverse transform sampling</title><link>https://mikoff.github.io/posts/inverse-transform-sampling.md/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 14:56:13 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://mikoff.github.io/posts/inverse-transform-sampling.md/</guid><description>Probability density and cumulative distribution functions Probability density function $f(x)$ is a function, which allows us to evaluate the probability that the sample, drawn from the distribution, will be equal to the value $X$. Also we can use PDF to calculate the probability that the randomly drawn sample from distribution will be in certain range, for example, $a \leq X \leq b$. This probability equals to the area under the PDF curve on the given interval and can be calculated by integration: $$ P(a \leq X \leq b) = \int _a^b f(x) dx $$ Cumulative distribution function shows us the probability (portion of data, frequence) to draw a number $X$ less or equal than $x$: $$ P(X \leq x) = F(x).</description></item></channel></rss>
