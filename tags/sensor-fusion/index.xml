So why particle filter is so widely used? It&amp;rsquo;s widespread application lies in its versatile nature and universalism. The filter is able to:
Work with nonlinearities. Handle non-gaussian distributions. Easily fuse various information sources. Simulate the processes. My sample implementation takes less then 100 lines of Python code and can be found here.</description></item></channel></rss>
