Such a problem often occures in robotics and other related fields. Usually we want jointly optimize the poses, their increments and various measurements. What we want to find is such set of parameters, that minimize the sum of residuals, or differences, between the real measurements and measurements, that we derive from our state.</description></item></channel></rss>
