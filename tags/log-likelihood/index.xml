Since the numerical values sometimes are extremely low that can lead to underflow problems. This problem is evident with particle filters - we have to multiply really low likelihood values that vanish in the end. Log-sum-exp allows to abbreviate this problem.
Approach Link to heading Log-likelihoods Link to heading Since the likelihood values can be extremely low it is more convenient to work with loglikelihood instead of likelihood: $$ \log(\mathcal{L}).</description></item></channel></rss>
