Coordinate systems notation Link to heading $\mathbf{R}_{wc}$ is a rotation matrix such that, after its application to the camera axes, they become collinear with the world axes. Some describe it as a matrix that rotates a vector from the camera coordinate system to the world coordinate system. However, this description can be slightly misleading, as vectors exist in space and are not physically rotated.</description></item></channel></rss>
